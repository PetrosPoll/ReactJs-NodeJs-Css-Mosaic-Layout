# Mosaic Layout Images

This is a small demo of creating mosaic layout with images using ReactJs for the front-end and NodeJs for the backend. The use is able to upload images which will be available on mosaic layout. 

Is just a clean example using only pure SCSS without and ready library. There is responsive for some screenviews and also very structured code and comments to show my skills.



## Installation
Do `npm install` on client and server folder where the `package.json` exists.

## Compile SCSS
On the client folder for the React project, run the following command to build the SCSS to CSS: `npm run build-css`

## Start the project
Run the following command to start the server and the client project: `npm start` on each folder
